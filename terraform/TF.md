## Best Terraform practices applied:

### 1. Definition of Variables:

- Inside `variables.tf`, you will find definitions for `container_name`, `image_name_and__tag`, `internal_port`, and `external_port`.
- Each variable is clearly described, ensuring easy understanding.
- Default values are set where applicable, making usage more convenient.
- Explicit data types are assigned to each variable for clarity.

### 2. Terraform Configuration:

- The `terraform` block explicitly states required providers, ensuring proper dependency management.
- Version constraints are specified for providers, promoting stability and predictability.

### 3. Configuration of Providers:

- Provider configuration is neatly separated from resources, which enhances readability and maintainability.

### 4. Declaration of Resources:

- Resources are aptly named, providing insight into their intended purpose.
- Interpolation dynamically incorporates variable values into resource attributes.
- Readability is improved through proper indentation and formatting.

### 5. Output Definitions:

- Essential information for potential downstream usage is exposed through defined outputs.
- Descriptive explanations accompany each output, aiding comprehension.
- Appropriate interpolation is used to access output values.

## Docker Terraform steps

### 1 Apply

```bash
terraform apply -var="container_name=lab4_terraform_docker_container"
```

```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with
